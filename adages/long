‘But, Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for
the last nine months.’ 'Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round
to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn’t exactly gone out of your way to
call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or
anything.’

'But the plans were on display…’

'On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.’

'That’s the display department.’

'With a torch.’

'The lights had probably gone out.’

'So had the stairs.’

'But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?’

'Yes,’ said Arthur, 'yes I did. It was on display at the bottom of a locked
filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying
beware of the leopard.’
