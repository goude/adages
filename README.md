## Dashes

> If write quote like so plain text:
>
> You really are the most devious bastard in New York City
>
> \- Laszlo Cravensworth
>
> What sort dash use? Hyphen en em other

For a quote attribution like this:

```text
You really are the most devious bastard in New York City
- Laszlo Cravensworth
```

a hyphen (`-`) is fine for informal contexts or casual writing. However, if you
want to adhere to formal typography or professional standards, an en dash (`–`)
is preferred, especially when separating a name or attribution from the body
text.

Here’s the version with an en dash:

```text
You really are the most devious bastard in New York City
– Laszlo Cravensworth
```

If you're aiming for the most polished appearance, use the en dash.

The use of the en dash (`–`) for attributions is a convention based on
typographic standards, commonly discussed in style guides and typography
manuals. For example:

1. **The Chicago Manual of Style** (CMOS) recommends en dashes for certain types
   of attribution in lists and quotes, though it doesn’t explicitly require it
   in all cases.
2. **The Elements of Typographic Style** by Robert Bringhurst, a classic
   reference on typography, supports the use of the en dash for connecting
   elements like attributions, as it visually balances better than a simple
   hyphen.
3. The hyphen (`-`) is typically used for compound words or as a general-purpose
   punctuation mark in casual or typewriter-style writing, but it's not ideal
   for professional typesetting.

While not universally mandated, many professional writers, designers, and
publishers adopt the en dash for elegance and readability. It’s a stylistic
choice informed by these resources.
