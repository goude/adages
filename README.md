## Dashes

> If write quote like so plain text:
>
> You really are the most devious bastard in New York City
>
> - Laszlo Cravensworth
>
> What sort dash use? Hyphen en em other

For a quote attribution like this:

```text
You really are the most devious bastard in New York City
- Laszlo Cravensworth
```

a hyphen (`-`) is fine for informal contexts or casual writing. However, if you
want to adhere to formal typography or professional standards, an en dash (`–`)
is preferred, especially when separating a name or attribution from the body
text.

Here’s the version with an en dash:

```text
You really are the most devious bastard in New York City
– Laszlo Cravensworth
```

If you're aiming for the most polished appearance, use the en dash.
